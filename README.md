# wedding
A wedding site with guest subscription.

Be careful the code is very messy with little organization I'm not a professional developer.
SvelteJS, PostgreSQL, tailwind (with daisyUI) allowed me to develop this very quickly and the result was amazing in term of reliability, compatibility, responsiveness and performance (with little effort). SvelteJS is especially easy to learn.
